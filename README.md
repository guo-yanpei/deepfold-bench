# Benchmarking DeepFold

Welcome to the repository dedicated to run all tests that performed in Deepfold.

## Overview

### Implementation
DeepFold is implemented using $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, with $p = 2^{61} - 1$ as the base field and Blake3 as the hash function. The chosen code rate is $2^{-3}$. To modify the code rate, adjust the `CODE_RATE` constant.

### Modules
  - **DeepFold**: The multi-linear FRI-based polynomial commitment scheme proposed in paper. Find this mainly in the `deepfold/` directory.
  - **Batch Variant of DeepFold**: The Batch evaluation version of DeepFold proposed in paper. Find this in the `batch/` directory.
  - **Other FRI-based Multi-linears**:
    - BaseFold in `basefold/` directory
    - FRI in `fri/` directory
    - PolyFRIM in `polyfrim/` directory
    - Virgo in `virgo/` directory
  <!-- - **VSS**: One to many univariate polynomial commitment from PolyFRIM, located in the `vss/` directory.
  - **AVSS**: One to many binary polynomail commitment from PolyFRIM, located in the `avss/` directory. -->

- **Utilities**: All the above protocols leverage utilities found in `util/`, which includes implementations for Merkle trees, finite fields, polynomials, and other necessary tools.

## Setup

1. **Install Rust**: Follow the instructions on [Rust Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
   
2. **Verify Installation**: Post-installation, ensure everything is set up correctly with:
   ```bash
   cargo --version
   rustup --version
   ```

3. **Use the Nightly Toolchain**: 
   ```bash
   rustup default nightly
   ```

## Benchmarking

- **Benchmark All Protocols**:
```bash
./scripts/all-in-one.sh
```

> **Note**: The scripts will also output the proof size of protocols. The results can be found in **outputs/** directory.

-- **Benchmark a Specific Protocol**
```bash
./scripts/deepfold-bench.sh
```

> **Note**: The most extensive benchmarking point may require approximately 50 GB of RAM.

-- **Change the Size of Polynomials**
```bash
./scripts/set-size.sh 15
```

- **Benchmark All Protocols**: 
  ```bash
  cargo bench
  ```
  
- **Benchmark a Specific Protocol**: Choose from `deepfold`, `basefold`, `fri`, `polyfrim`, or `virgo`.
  ```bash
  cargo bench -p <protocol>
  ```
  
> **Note**: The most extensive benchmarking point may require approximately 50 GB of RAM.

<!-- ## Running Tests & Determining Proof Size

- **Test All Protocols & Output Proof Sizes**: 
  ```bash
  cargo test -- --nocapture
  ```

- **Test & Output Proof Size for a Specific Protocol**: Choose from `deepfold`, `basefold`, `fri`, `polyfrim`, or `virgo`.
  ```bash
  cargo test -p <protocol> -- --nocapture
  ``` -->

## GKR

For the multi-linear polynomial commitment in Virgo, there's an included GKR.
The Benchmarking script runs both PCS and GKR parts of Virgo automatically, but the results need to be sumed up for comparing with other protocols.

<!-- **Benchmarking GKR**:
1. Execute `bench_gkr.py` within the `virgo/` directory.
2. This script calls the executable `virgo/fft_gkr` and produces the GKR prover time, verifier time, and proof size. -->

> **Note**: The executable originates from [Virgo](https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/Virgo), and we're directly utilizing it here.

<!-- For the final evaluation result of Virgo, it's essential to sum the results from the Rust implementation and the GKR. This summation is a manual process. -->
